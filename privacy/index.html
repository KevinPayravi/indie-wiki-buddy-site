        <p>
            Privacy policy last updated August 21, 2024
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Cloudflare's privacy policy is available
            <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">here</a>.
            <br /><br />
            The Indie Wiki Buddy browser extension links to and redirects users to external, third-party websites
            not controlled by the extension. These websites have their own privacy policies and practices. Users
            should visit these websites at their own risk.
            <br /><br />
            Indie Wiki Buddy's settings and stats are stored in your browser's storage, both locally and in 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync">
            sync storage</a> (if supported).
            <br /><br />
            Indie Wiki Buddy can see which Fandom, Fextralife, and Neoseeker wikis you visit for the purpose of
            redirecting you to alternative wikis and the BreezeWiki alternative frontend, if enabled.
            Your browsing history on these websites is not stored or transmitted anywhere by Indie Wiki Buddy.
            <br /><br />
            Indie Wiki Buddy can also see your activity on search engines (as of version 3.6.0, this includes
            Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, Brave, Ecosia, Startpage, Qwant, Kagi, and Yandex).
            This allows Indie Wiki Buddy to filter search engine results for Fandom and Fextralife wikis.
            Your activity on search engines is not stored or transmitted anywhere by Indie Wiki Buddy.
            <br /><br />
            If the BreezeWiki redirect functionality has been enabled, the extension will pull a list of working
            BreezeWiki instances from
            <a href="https://bw.getindie.wiki/instances.json">https://bw.getindie.wiki/instances.json</a>,
            which is managed by the Indie Wiki Buddy developer and delivered via Cloudlfare Pages.
            This is done in order to provide
            the extension with an up-to-date list of working BreezeWiki mirrors.
            <br /><br />
            Your browser and the online store you acquire the extension through (e.g.
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">Chrome Web Store</a> or
            <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/">Firefox Add-ons</a>) may perform its own
            data collection.
